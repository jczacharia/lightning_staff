# Lightning Staff (aka Stotem)

This is largest project to date. Lightning Staff is a portable hiking stick/staff that provides 360-degree lighting and animations. The design entails an RGB LED strip wrapped around the staff with built in electronics mounted at the top enclosed in a custom 3D printed housing. The brain of Lightning Staff is an ARM microcontroller. It has a Lithium Ion battery management system with an estimated usage time of 4 hours at full brightness. Additionally, Lighting Staff has Bluetooth connectivity with a supported IOS/Android app that controls the staffâ€™s settings, animations, brightness, and power management. The brightness and animations can also be controlled by a rotary encoder on the staff.
